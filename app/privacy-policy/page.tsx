        SECTION 1 - WHAT DO WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        When you purchase something from our store, as part of the buying and
        selling process, we collect the personal information you give us such as
        your name, address and email address. When you browse our store, we also
        automatically receive your computer{"'"}s internet protocol (IP) address
        in order to provide us with information that helps us learn about your
        browser and operating system. Email marketing: With your permission, we
        may send you emails about our store, new products and other updates.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">SECTION 2 - CONSENT</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        How do you get my consent? When you provide us with your personal
        information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an
        order, arrange for a shipment or make a return, we imply that you
        consent to its collection and use for that specific reason only. If we
        ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like
        marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent,
        or provide you with an opportunity to say no.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        How can I withdraw my consent? If after you opt-in, you change your
        mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the
        continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any
        time, by contacting us at info@noir-clothing.com or writing to us at:
        Noir Clothing, Calle Nobel 5, Floor 1, Door 3B, Mairena del Aljarafe
        (Seville) 41927, Spain.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        We may disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by
        law or if you violate our Terms of Service.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">SECTION 4 - VERCEL</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Our store is hosted by Vercel. They provide us with the online
        e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to
        you. Your data is stored through Vercel{"'"}s data storage, databases,
        and the general Vercel application. Your data is stored on a secure
        server behind a firewall.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Payment: If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your
        purchase, then Vercel stores your credit card data. It is encrypted
        through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your
        purchase transaction data is stored only to the extent necessary to
        complete the purchase transaction. After it is complete, your purchase
        transaction information is erased.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as
        outlined by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort
        of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover. PCI-DSS
        requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information
        from stores and their service providers. For a clearer overview, you may
        also want to read the Vercel Terms of Service or Privacy Statement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">
        SECTION 5 - THIRD PARTY SERVICES
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use
        and disclose your information to the extent necessary to enable them to
        perform the services they provide to us. However, some third-party
        service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment
        transaction processors, have their own privacy policies regarding the
        information that we are required to provide to them for transactions
        related to purchases. For these providers, we recommend that you read
        the privacy policies so that you can understand how your personal
        information will be handled.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        In particular, remember that some providers may be located or have
        facilities that are in a different jurisdiction than you or us. So if
        you wish to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a
        third party provider, your information may be subject to the laws of the
        jurisdiction (jurisdictions) in which the service provider or its
        facilities are located.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        By way of example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is
        processed by a payment gateway based in the United States, then your
        personal information used to complete the transaction may be subject to
        disclosure under United States law, including the Patriot Act. Once you
        leave our store website or redirect to a third-party site or
        application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or the
        Terms of Service of our website.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Links: When you click on links in our store, you may be redirected off
        our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other
        sites and we recommend that you read their privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">SECTION 6 - SAFETY</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
        To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and
        follow industry best practices to ensure that it is not improperly lost,
        misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. If you provide us
        with your credit card information, this information is encrypted using
        Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and stored with AES-256 encryption.
        Although no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic
        storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement
        additional industry-accepted standards.
